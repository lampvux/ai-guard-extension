# AI Guard - Chrome Extension

AI Guard is a Chrome extension that protects users from malicious links and detects AI-generated content in Google search results.

## Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Link Protection
- **Domain Verification**: Checks if the actual link matches the displayed URL
- **Suspicious Pattern Detection**: Identifies IP addresses, URL shorteners, and punycode domains
- **Homograph Attack Detection**: Detects lookalike characters used in phishing attempts
- **Click Interception**: Warns users before navigating to suspicious links

### ü§ñ AI Content Detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common AI-generated phrases and structures
- **Writing Style Analysis**: Detects overly formal language and repetitive patterns
- **Grammar Analysis**: Checks for perfect grammar and lack of contractions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides a percentage-based confidence level for AI detection

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Settings
- Toggle link protection on/off
- Toggle AI detection on/off
- Beautiful options page with detailed feature descriptions

## Installation

### From Source
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

   - ‚úì Green checkmark: Link verified as safe
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Orange warning: Suspicious link detected
   - ü§ñ Robot icon: AI-generated content detected
   - üë§ Person icon: Likely human-written content

4. **Click Protection**: When clicking suspicious links, you'll see a confirmation dialog
5. **Settings**: Click the extension icon and then "Settings" to customize features

## How It Works

### Link Protection Algorithm
- Extracts and compares actual vs displayed domains
- Checks against known suspicious patterns
- Detects homograph attacks using lookalike character mappings
- Identifies URL shorteners that could hide malicious destinations

### AI Detection Algorithm
- Analyzes text for common AI language patterns
- Examines sentence structure repetition
- Calculates formality ratio based on word usage
- Checks for perfect grammar and lack of contractions
- Generates confidence score (0-100%)

## Privacy

AI Guard operates entirely locally in your browser:
- No data is sent to external servers
- No personal information is collected
- All analysis happens in real-time on your device

### Building for Release

#### Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)
The extension includes a GitHub Action workflow that automatically creates minified release builds:

- **Trigger**: Push a tag starting with `v` (e.g., `v1.0.0`) or manually trigger the workflow
- **Process**: Minifies all JavaScript and HTML files, copies required assets, creates a release zip
- **Output**: Downloadable artifact and GitHub release with the minified extension

To create a release:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

#### Local Builds
For local development and testing:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
build.bat
```

Both scripts will:
1. Install required tools (`terser` and `html-minifier-terser`)
2. Minify all JavaScript files (reduces size by ~60-70%)
3. Minify all HTML files (removes whitespace and comments)
4. Copy all required files to a `build/` directory
5. Create a `ai-guard-extension-release.zip` file ready for distribution

#### Build Requirements
- Node.js (for minification tools)
- `terser` (JavaScript minifier)
- `html-minifier-terser` (HTML minifier)

The build scripts will automatically install these tools if they're not present.

### Technologies Used
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Chrome APIs (storage, tabs, webNavigation)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Terser for JavaScript minification
- html-minifier-terser for HTML minification
